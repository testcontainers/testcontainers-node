# General Docker requirements

## Overview

Testcontainers requires a Docker-API compatible container runtime. 
During development, Testcontainers is actively tested against recent versions of Docker on Linux, as well as against Docker Desktop on Mac and Windows. 
These Docker environments are automatically detected and used by Testcontainers without any additional configuration being necessary.

It is possible to configure Testcontainers to work for other Docker setups, such as a remote Docker host or Docker alternatives. 
However, these are not actively tested in the main development workflow, so not all Testcontainers features might be available and additional manual configuration might be necessary. 
If you have further questions about configuration details for your setup or whether it supports running Testcontainers-based tests, 
please contact the Testcontainers team and other users from the Testcontainers community on [Slack](https://slack.testcontainers.org/).

## Using Colima?

In order to run testcontainers against [colima](https://github.com/abiosoft/colima) the env vars bellow should be set

```bash
export TESTCONTAINERS_DOCKER_SOCKET_OVERRIDE=/var/run/docker.sock
export DOCKER_HOST="unix://${HOME}/.colima/docker.sock"
```

## Docker environment discovery

Testcontainers will try to connect to a Docker daemon using the following strategies in order:

* Environment variables:
	* `DOCKER_HOST`
	* `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`
	* `DOCKER_CERT_PATH`
* Defaults:
	* `DOCKER_HOST=https://localhost:2376`
	* `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=1`
	* `DOCKER_CERT_PATH=~/.docker`
* If Docker Machine is installed, the docker machine environment for the *first* machine found. Docker Machine needs to be on the PATH for this to succeed.
* If you're going to run your tests inside a container, please read [Patterns for running tests inside a docker container](continuous_integration/dind_patterns.md) first.

## Docker registry authentication

Testcontainers will try to authenticate to registries with supplied config using the following strategies in order:

* Environment variables:
    * `DOCKER_AUTH_CONFIG`
* Docker config
	* At location specified in `DOCKER_CONFIG` or at `{HOME}/.docker/config.json`
