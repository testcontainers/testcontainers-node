# Waiting for containers to start or be ready

!!! info "Wait strategies vs Startup strategies"

    **Wait strategy:** is the container in a state that is useful for testing. This is generally approximated as 'can we talk to this container over the network'. However, there are quite a few variations and nuances.
    
    **Startup strategy:** did a container reach the desired running state. *Almost always* this just means 'wait until the container is running' - for a daemon process in a container this is the goal. Sometimes we need to wait until the container reaches a running state and then exits - this is the 'one shot startup' strategy, only used for cases where we need to run a one off command in a container but not a daemon.


## Wait Strategies

Ordinarily Testcontainers will wait for up to 60 seconds for the container's first mapped network port to start listening.

This simple measure provides a basic check whether a container is ready for use.

<!--codeinclude--> 
[Waiting for the first exposed port to start listening](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/generic/WaitStrategiesTest.java) inside_block:waitForNetworkListening
<!--/codeinclude-->

If the default 60s timeout is not sufficient, it can be altered with the `withStartupTimeout()` method.

If waiting for a listening TCP port is not sufficient to establish whether the container is ready, you can use the
`waitingFor()` method with other [`WaitStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/wait/strategy/WaitStrategy.html) implementations as shown below.

### HTTP Wait strategy examples

You can choose to wait for an HTTP(S) endpoint to return a particular status code.

#### Waiting for 200 OK
<!--codeinclude--> 
[](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/generic/WaitStrategiesTest.java) inside_block:waitForSimpleHttp
<!--/codeinclude-->

Variations on the HTTP wait strategy are supported, including:

#### Waiting for multiple possible status codes
<!--codeinclude--> 
[](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/generic/WaitStrategiesTest.java) inside_block:waitForHttpWithMultipleStatusCodes
<!--/codeinclude-->

#### Waiting for a status code that matches a predicate
<!--codeinclude--> 
[Waiting for a status code that matches a predicate](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/generic/WaitStrategiesTest.java) inside_block:waitForHttpWithStatusCodePredicate
<!--/codeinclude-->

#### Using TLS
<!--codeinclude-->

<!--/codeinclude-->

### Healthcheck Wait strategy examples

If the used image supports Docker's [Healthcheck](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck) feature, you can directly leverage the `healthy` state of the container as your wait condition:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/generic/WaitStrategiesTest.java) inside_block:healthcheckWait
<!--/codeinclude-->

### Log output Wait Strategy

In some situations a container's log output is a simple way to determine if it is ready or not.
For example, we can wait for a `Ready' message in the container's logs as follows:

<!--codeinclude-->
[](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/generic/WaitStrategiesTest.java) inside_block:logMessageWait
<!--/codeinclude-->

### Other Wait Strategies

For further options, check out the [`Wait`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/wait/strategy/Wait.html) convenience class, or the various subclasses of [`WaitStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/wait/strategy/WaitStrategy.html). 

If none of these options meet your requirements, you can create your own subclass of 
[`AbstractWaitStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/wait/strategy/AbstractWaitStrategy.html) with an 
appropriate wait mechanism in `waitUntilReady()`. 
The `GenericContainer.waitingFor()` method accepts any valid [`WaitStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/wait/strategy/WaitStrategy.html).


## Startup check Strategies

Ordinarily Testcontainers will check that the container has reached the running state and has not exited.
In order to do that inspect is executed against the container and state parameter is extracted.

All logic is implemented in [`StartupCheckStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/startupcheck/StartupCheckStrategy.html) child classes.

### Running startup strategy example

This is the strategy used by default. Testcontainers just checks if container is running.

Implemented in [`IsRunningStartupCheckStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers/startupcheck/IsRunningStartupCheckStrategy.html) class.

### One shot startup strategy example

This strategy is intended for use with containers that only run briefly and exit of their own accord. As such, success is deemed to be when
the container has stopped with exit code 0.
 
<!--codeinclude--> 
[Using one shot startup strategy](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/org/testcontainers/containers/startupcheck/StartupCheckStrategyTest.java) inside_block:withOneShotStrategy
<!--/codeinclude-->

### Indefinite one shot startup strategy example

Variant of one shot strategy that does not impose a timeout. Intended for situation such as when a long running task forms part of
 container startup.

It has to be assumed that the container will stop of its own accord, either with a success or failure exit code.

<!--codeinclude--> 
[Using indefinite one shot startup strategy](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/org/testcontainers/containers/startupcheck/StartupCheckStrategyTest.java) inside_block:withIndefiniteOneShotStrategy
<!--/codeinclude-->

### Minimum duration startup strategy example

Checks that the container is running and has been running for a defined minimum period of time.

<!--codeinclude--> 
[Using minimum duration strategy](../examples/junit4/generic/src/test/java/org/testcontainers/containers/startupcheck/StartupCheckStrategyTest.java) inside_block:withMinimumDurationStrategy
<!--/codeinclude-->

### Other startup  strategies

If none of these options meet your requirements, you can create your own subclass of 
[`StartupCheckStrategy`](http://static.javadoc.io/org.testcontainers/testcontainers/{{ latest_version }}/org/testcontainers/containers
/startupcheck/StartupCheckStrategy.html) with an appropriate startup check mechanism in `waitUntilStartupSuccessful()`.
Or you can leave it as is and just implement the `checkStartupState(DockerClient dockerClient, String containerId)` if you still want to check state
 periodically.

## Depending on another container

Sometimes, a container relies on another container to be ready before it should start itself. An example of this might be a database that needs to be started before your application container can link to it. You can tell a container that it depends on another container by using the `dependsOn` method:
